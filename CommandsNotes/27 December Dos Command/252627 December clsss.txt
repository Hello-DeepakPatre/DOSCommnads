DOS Based OS like- windows use DOS command shell.

Unix Based OS like-Linux and thair different flavour use Base shell.

Almost both are interpreted scripting language.  But linux bash shell is case-sensitive.

Scripting languages are loosely and weak languages they work without some rules and regualtion.

From Dos help
-----------------------
Note:First must be read your written note.

..   Specifies that you want to change to the parent directory.

Type CD drive: to display the current directory in the specified drive.
Type CD without parameters to display the current drive and directory.

Use the /D switch to change current drive in addition to changing current
directory for a drive.

If Command Extensions are enabled CHDIR changes as follows:

The current directory string is converted to use the same case as
the on disk names.  So CD C:\TEMP would actually set the current
directory to C:\Temp if that is the case on disk.

CHDIR command does not treat spaces as delimiters, so it is possible to
CD into a subdirectory name that contains a space without surrounding
the name with quotes.  For example:

    cd \winnt\profiles\username\programs\start menu

is the same as:

    cd "\winnt\profiles\username\programs\start menu"

which is what you would have to type if extensions were disabled.
